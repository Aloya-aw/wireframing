# Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual blueprint of a digital interface, such as a website or app screen. It outlines the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a page without focusing on detailed design elements like colors, images, or typography. Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders quickly visualize how a user will interact with the system. They play a crucial role in the design process by encouraging early feedback, reducing misunderstandings, and allowing for easy adjustments before high-fidelity designs or coding begins.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe
1. **Layout Structure:**
    * **Explanation:** This refers to the overall arrangement or skeleton of the page. It defines how sections like the header, sidebar, main content, and footer are organized on the screen.
    
    * **Example:** In an e-commerce site, the layout might place a banner at the top, a category sidebar on the left, and product listings in the main area. This helps users quickly understand where to look for what.

2. **Navigation**
    * **Explanation:** Navigation elements allow users to move through the interface easily. These include menus, tabs, buttons, and breadcrumb trails.

    * **Example:** A top navigation bar with links to “Home,” “Browse Rooms,” “My Bookings,” and “Help” helps users access different parts of a hotel booking app efficiently.

3. **Content Placement**
    * **Explanation:** This involves deciding where text, images, forms, or calls-to-action will appear on the page. Good content placement improves readability and user engagement.

    * **Example:** Placing a hotel name, rating, and booking button near the top of a listing card ensures users quickly find key info without scrolling too much.

4. **Functionality**
   * **Explanation:** This represents interactive components that define what users can do on the page. Even though wireframes are not fully functional, they often show placeholders for actions like input fields, buttons, and dropdowns.

    * **Example:** A date picker for selecting check-in/check-out dates or a “Book Now” button shows the intended user actions during the checkout process.
