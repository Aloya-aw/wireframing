# Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual blueprint of a digital interface, such as a website or app screen. It outlines the basic structure, layout, and functionality of a page without focusing on detailed design elements like colors, images, or typography. Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders quickly visualize how a user will interact with the system. They play a crucial role in the design process by encouraging early feedback, reducing misunderstandings, and allowing for easy adjustments before high-fidelity designs or coding begins.
